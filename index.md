## Welcome to Oguz Han's GitHub Pages

I'm a phd student at Istanbul Uni. Department of Astronomy and Space Sciences.
I'm interested in Galactic Astronomy such as Red Giant stars and Red Clump stars of the Milky Way.
I've worked on dynamics and kinematics of the Milky Way using with Red Clump stars during master. Now, I'm working on "chemical formation and evolution of the solar neighborhood" and my thesis topic related to it.
